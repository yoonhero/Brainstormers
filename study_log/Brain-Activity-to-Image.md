# Hyperrealistic neural decoding for reconstructing faces from fMRI activations via the GAN latent space.

> We show the the latent vectors used for generation effectively capture the same defining stimulus properties as the fMRI measurements.

*Neural Decoding*: brain responses -> Feature Map -> sensory stimuli

- Brain responses -> Feature Map = *Linear*
- Feature Map -> sensory stimuli = *Nonlinear*

Why Feature Map?: data efficient (given that neural data is scarce) & test alternative hypothesis
